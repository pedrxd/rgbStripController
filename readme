Now, you can control your rgb strip with this program directly uploading this code to it.
Actualy i am starting to implement some animations and alghoritms for do a awesome things.
As i say, i am starting, probably there are just a few animations and mode, but this will
be growing as i have time for write code.

==============================
Features
==============================
- Control using bluetooth
- Rainbow mode
- Strike mode
- Smooth change between colors
- Control brithness
- Change speed

==============================
Bluetooth command syntax
==============================
The basic structure is
<var><value>
Some var don't need a value and all can be concated in the same command.
<var><value><var><var><value>
For a fast response from arduino a ',' is required where the command terminated.
<var><value><var><var><value>,

The available var are:
- r   Change the color of red, Value range 0-255
- g   Change the color of green, Value range 0-255
- b   Change the color of blue, Value range 0-255
- a   Set brightness, Value range 0-255

- d   Set the delay or timing or duration for all animations, Value on Milliseconds

- s   It swicth off the led smoothly in the defined duration, Value not needed
- m   You can select mode using it, Value range 0-3 (Where 0:StaticColor;1:RainBow;2:Strike;3:RandomStrike)

Real Examples:
 - Set red high, blue high, green high with 100 of brightness.
	r255b255g255a100,
 - Set red high, blue 100, and off it smoothly on 2 seconds.
	r255b100s,
 - Set rainbowmode
	m1,
